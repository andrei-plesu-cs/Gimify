# Gimify
A mobile ready ideal companion for the gym, made with Angular and Bootstrap on the front end, and Firebase services on the back end. Being a Single Page Application, it also provides authentication and authorization, route guarding, validation, and quick access to the cloud database provided by Google through Firebase. The app is also a PWA as it's caching data through service workers for further offline ussage. Also, being PWA, it could be installed from the web to the home screen with just one click. Design of the app was made by the help of Adobe XD.

If you want to use it, clone the repo, then run npm install on the gimifyApp folder, then, if you have Algular cli installed run ng serve which will open the application on port 4200.
